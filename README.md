# Portfolio Version 2

This is a second take on my portfolio! I have update the code since progressing in the bootcamp.

---

## Built With

- React and Vite
- Bulma CSS
- Javascript

## Deployment

The App Is Deployed In The Following Location

- [Portfolio](https://clinquant-dieffenbachia-0ac6e1.netlify.app) I used Netlify to host.

## Tuition Payments

- Overall, this actually went pretty smoothly. The deploy to netlify was great, and is something I will look to use more in the future.

- The one issue that had me stumped was when deploying was why my profile image was not working. I ultimately was able to get this working when I added it into the `public` directory.

## How To Contribute

Please, follow these guidelines below:

- I am not expecting contributions, but if there is a code issue I would like to learn more about it!

## Acknowledgements

- I performed a couple "sanity checks" to see the choices I was making were leading me on the right path.

- I had Chat GPT help bounce some ideas off of to again help me learn more and debug when I was not doing things the right way.

- Other than that, I did it all my own and nothing was copied.

## Final Note

- This was so much fun! I really enjoyed being able to code this. I wanted to keep things clean, simple, but informative too. I plan to keep this layout, for now, and add to the site and keep the good things coming. Learning this, seeing what I can do already, it really gets me excited to see what I can do as I keep on learning.
